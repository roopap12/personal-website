  <h2 className="star-model-heading">Star Model Scenario: Implementing Secure Data Fetching</h2>
  <p className="star-model-description">
    <strong>Situation:</strong> During the development of our e-commerce project, there arose a critical need to fetch sensitive data from the backend server. The nature of the data demanded a robust security framework to safeguard against potential threats and unauthorized access.
  </p>
  <p className="star-model-description">
    <strong>Task:</strong> My task was to implement a secure data fetching mechanism that adhered to industry standards and best practices. Given my background in Cybersecurity, I recognized the importance of establishing multiple layers of protection to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
  </p>

  <div className="star-model-action">
    <p className="star-model-task-heading"><strong>Action:</strong> Safeguarding Data Integrity</p>
    <ul className="star-model-action-list">
      <li className="star-model-action-item">
        <strong>Action 1:</strong> Encryption Protocols - Implemented strong encryption protocols for data transmission between the frontend and backend, employing state-of-the-art algorithms to protect against eavesdropping.
      </li>
      <li className="star-model-action-item">
        <strong>Action 2:</strong> Token-based Authentication - Employed token-based authentication mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to ensure that only authenticated users could access the sensitive data. This added an extra layer of security by validating the identity of the user.
      </li>
      <li className="star-model-action-item">
        <strong>Action 3:</strong> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - Configured CORS policies to restrict access to the backend resources only from authorized domains, preventing potential security vulnerabilities associated with cross-origin requests.
      </li>
      <li className="star-model-action-item">
        <strong>Action 4:</strong> Input Validation - Implemented thorough input validation checks on the frontend and backend to mitigate the risk of injection attacks. This included sanitizing and validating user inputs to prevent malicious input from reaching the backend.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p className="star-model-description">
    <strong>Result:</strong> The implementation of these security measures resulted in a robust and secure data fetching system. The sensitive data was transmitted and stored with utmost confidentiality, and the project successfully passed security audits.
