                Hello, I'm Roopa Patel, a dynamic Full Stack Web Developer and
                Cybersecurity Analyst based in Auckland. With a strong
                foundation in coding and a passion for innovation, I've honed my
                skills to deliver seamless solutions that drive results.
              </p>

              <p>
                My expertise spans across JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and
                MongoDB, with a special focus on AI and cybersecurity. I've
                successfully developed chatbots using FastAPI and Langchan,
                demonstrating my dedication to staying at the cutting edge of
                technology. My recent journey into cybersecurity has been both
                challenging and rewarding, as I've applied my technical acumen
                to real-world security challenges and contributed to the
                protection of digital assets.
              </p>

              <p>
                My professional journey is marked by a blend of technical
                leadership and strategic decision-making. I've held positions as
                a Director at Elite Business Services and Financial Controller
                at Avis Rental Cars, where I've led teams to success and made
                critical financial decisions that drove business growth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond the corporate world, I've also been a Choreographer at
                Swaminarayan Temple, where I've expressed my creativity through
                dance. This creative outlet complements my technical pursuits,
                providing a well-rounded perspective on life and art.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in backend development,
                exploring various coding languages, and keeping pace with the
                latest tech trends. My commitment to personal well-being is as
                strong as my professional ambition. I practice yoga and
                meditation daily, which helps me maintain a balance between my
                professional and personal life, ensuring that I remain focused
                and energized in all aspects of my career.
